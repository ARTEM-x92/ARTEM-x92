Q0 { Why You Not Publish The Source Code Of Your Projects ? }

A0 { 

  0x00: Before Publishing Source Code Or Executable Files, They Must Be UnderGo Multiple Checks With Using Various Methods

    0x0000: Checking MetaData Of All Files (To Maintain My Personal Privacy)

    0x0001: Checking Executable Files To Find Out How Likely They Are To Be Hacked Or What Information Can Get a User Who Reverse Engineered / DisAssembled My Code _(0x000100)


  0x01: All (99%) Executable Files Not Have a User-Friendly Interface (CLI Messages Or GUI) There Is No Help Or Information To Help You Understand How To Use It

    0x0100: I Will Try To Make a Minimal Information Or GUI So That Help All Users Can Understand How To Use It

_(0x000100) I Developed a Beta ASM Bluff Bin To Be Close Access Code With Any UnAuthorized Operations (Reverse Engineering / Disassembly Or Other UnAuthorized Access Attempts) (ASM_Bluff_Beta.bin Works Only With x64 Code, ARM x64 Does Not Work Correctly With Many Types Of Code.) This Bin Will Never Be Open Source And Will Only Run On Specific HW And OS (Custom GNU_Linux)
